Although most characters documented survive in the final release, they aren't necessarily the only ones to undergo a great deal of evolution. Thanks to 2 new releases, there is a great deal more known about the female assassin's development, from its roughest to its final state before being cut (and later reused).

    The earliest set of textures shows a unique style not seen in the other earliest texture sets. It's a strange combination of a UV grid and direct vertex-lit lighting. Every one of the textures ends in "mesh", with a couple of newer ones included without this convention. What, if anything, was used for the eye is ambiguous. There are 2 miscellaneous textures - blah.tga and specmask.tga.

    The Fassassin has a tendency to incompletely change. For example, this reuses "footmesh" from the prior version - it has the same UV grid the prior one uses. While the textures for this are 'unreleased', it can be recreated with little compromise.<br><br>
    <ul>  
      <li>As aforementioned, foot.tga from v1 is reused.</li>
      <li>v1's newer Chest2.tga and belt.tga match.</li>
      <li>The Leak's unused legdiffuse.vtf serves perfectly as both a leg and arm texture.</li>
      <li>This version's hand.vtf, pouch.vtf and neck.vtf are still used in the Leak.</li>  
      <li>The head can be recreated, at the top, from the alpha channel of the normal map, and the bottom from the Leak head with no modification.</li>
    </ul>
    Oddly, the belt texture here is heavily vertical (as is the normal map for v3), but the UVs between version 1 and 3 are identical.

    The leak contains a version which appears to be an attempt to make v4 before a reUVing was performed. This is more incomplete than the prior version, with 3 of v2's textures still used, and plenty left over.

## Version 4: 'Final'

    The final version. It is available in the repo, but the sheet was also available in the Leak - just not the model with the new UVs for it. Despite the radical changes to the textures prior, this is the only one to make model changes; the head is slightly larger.

## Version A: HL2: Survivor

      In creating the final Combine Elite, a quick modification to the Combine Soldier was made by adding the head to it, and the head texture over the normal one. This one possesses a uniformly red eye.
